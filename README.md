IBR-DTN - A modular and lightweight implementation of the bundle protocol.
==========================================================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ibrdtn/ibrdtn.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ibrdtn/ibrdtn)
[![Coverage Status](https://img.shields.io/coveralls/ibrdtn/ibrdtn.svg)](https://coveralls.io/r/ibrdtn/ibrdtn)

This implementation of the bundle protocol RFC5050 is designed for embedded
systems like the RouterBoard 532A or Ubiquiti RouterStation Pro and can be
used as framework for DTN applications.

The module-based architecture with miscellaneous interfaces, makes it possible
to change functionalities like routing or storage of bundle just by inheriting
a specific class.
